					About the project
				%p
					ThrivePass offers health perks to active employees for any company that signs up for the service. We created a simple mobile application that allows users to log their activities within the platform. Perks are calculated and delivered based on frequency of activity logging.

					My role
				%p
					I was hired by ThrivePass to help them quickly develop a first cut of their mobile application, with a design system extendable enough to support new functionality as learnings progressed.

						The Groundwork
					%h3.triple-margin-bottom
						Our goal in releasing the product was to move as quickly as possible to begin testing our assumptions. We mapped out a very basic user flow and organized activity commonalities from the existing desktop experience.

					Prototype
				%p
					Half a week after kicking off the project, we had a functioning prototype. The prototype was designed to explore each activity flow. The ability to log workouts and measurements was available on the existing desktop app. We then added the ability to track workouts through “verified check ins” to the mobile experience. We then explored all the edge cases of the new and existing functionality. 
				%h6

					Allowing users to add a new location to the existing database started out as a big deal to us. Ultimately though, we decided to pull it from the first version of the app.

						Design Decisions
					%h3
						We worked toward two design variations of the ThrivePass app. For both, we chose to embrace Google Material Design patterns, as this system translates well across IOS and Android operating systems.

						Icons
					%p
						We didn’t want the design of the app to suffer as a result of our ambitious timeline. It was important that the app still feel polished and friendly, even as a version 1.0. 
					%p
						In response to this, we created a simple set of icons to help bring the design to life and compliment our color system.
