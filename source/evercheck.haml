          About the project
        %p
          Evercheck offers license verification services. They help companies stay ahead with an industry leading platform. We enhanced the way people interacted with their service as a whole: from the first time people viewed their marketing site, to the interaction and design of the mobile and desktop experience.

          My Role
        %p
          I worked with Evercheck to design their first mobile application offering. I then set out to completely re-design the desktop experience, starting with wireframes and working all the way through the marketing site.

          Before the update, the desktop app had a great functionality base. It was clear, however that there was a need for some re-organization. Over time, the user interface had outgrown its initial design system.

            Room for all
          %p
            Our first step was to design a solution that would accommodate an ever-growing site structure. We started by identifying major buckets of functionality. We then added supporting sub-navigation layouts. Each layout was mapped to a variable page system so that they could be infinitely extendable.

            Reusable Components
          %p
            After exploring navigation, we identified components of the interface and applied the same extendable thinking. We designed a robust table that allowed for optional functionality based on requirements. We built a color coordinated system for different license types including a way to organize status indications and form elements. All of these elements were key to the functionality of any page.

            Putting it all Together
          %p
            With our layout and components assembled, we explored a light and approachable design palette. We made use of existing brand elements so the new layout would feel familiar to existing users. From there, like painting a house, we applied the design to each page of the application working from our wireframe blueprints.

            Who Said Software Isnâ€™t Any Fun?
          %p
            We were tasked with the goal of giving the marketing website a unique personality. To accomplish this, I created three illustration styles, designed to work together to create an overarching feeling of positivity in the offering.
